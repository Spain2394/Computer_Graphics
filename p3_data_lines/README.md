## Program 3 (Geometric Transformations)

## Submit the following:

## 1. Submit your source code (only the file with your source code)
Note: I built ```Displaypixels(datalines, num)``` it can be called using ```viz.draw(datelines)``` with more relevant functionality. 

## 2. Submit a video or several screenshots of:

a) Input lines from a separated file (e.g. a txt file) and display it \
Input lines from ```./input/line.txt```: (80 50 150 200), (100 300 300 300) \

a0) Apply a Scale (2, 1, 10, 10) --> Display the result. Green line is the original, pink line is after it has been scaled. I showed two lines for validation.

a1) After you apply the scale, apply a Rotate (30Â°, 10, 10) --> Display the result. Green line is the original, pink line is after it has been scaled and rotated.\

b) Generate a file that contains your final result Input what you just generate and display it. Output lines from ```./output/data.txt``` 

b0) Text file of generated text file \
<img src="./output/ps3-2-b-0.png" heigh=200 width=200> 

b1) Image generated after using file from text file in b0. Only shows output lines that were pink in a1) the transformation only is shown below\
Before writting: \
<img src="./output/ps3-2-a-1-b.png" heigh=200 width=200>
After reading from file in b0) \
<img src="./output/ps3-2-b-1.png" heigh=200 width=200>

## 3. Some other intesting examples 
All original lines are drawn in green, those after transformation are in pink. \
a) triangle scaled by 2 in x and y and transformed about the original traingles center\
<img src="./output/ps3-triangle-1.png" heigh=200 width=200>
b) rotation \

<img src="./output/ps3-triangle-2.png" heigh=200 width=200>
c) Rotate from in increments of 5 \

<img src="./output/ps3-triangle-3.png" heigh=200 width=200>
b) Cube, guessing centriod (Original cube near origin) scale without translation\

<img src="./output/ps3-cube-1.png" heigh=200 width=200>
e) Scale with translation\

<img src="./output/ps3-cube-2.png" heigh=200 width=200>
f) Rotate after translation and scale, with updated and original cube.\

g) Just because it looks cool. The video file can be found here [./output/ps3-cube-4.mov](./output/ps3-cube-4.mov)\
